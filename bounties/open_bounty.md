# Open Bounty

## Introduction

At Mintbase, we value innovation and quality, offering rewards up to $3,000 for the development of new templates. 

Mintbase Templates are grab-and-go solutions to effortlessly launch blockchain activations like Minsta for events and AI minter for branding. These templates allow any developer to deploy functional applications with a single click, thanks to MintbaseJS and Mintbase GraphQL APIs. This bounty tackles a specific community-requested feature so you'll be making direct impact with your work. 

Your submited Mintbase Template should be a user friendly DApp with a seamless end to end user journey. The source code should be easy to brand and include instructions for other developers to use it.

## Overview

This open bounty presents an opportunity for developers, designers, and innovators to showcase their creativity on the NEAR Protocol. We are seeking proposals for decentralized applications (DApps) that introduce novel utilities for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Your challenge is to think outside the conventional frameworks of NFTs, exploring new functionalities, interactions, and value propositions that can be integrated into the digital asset space. Aim to develop a concept that leverages the unique capabilities of the NEAR Protocol, offering users fresh and engaging experiences with NFTs.
